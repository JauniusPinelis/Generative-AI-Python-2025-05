- Open source LLMs
- Models have various sizes.
- Models have their own advantages. Some have vision, some have reasoning,
some are more suited for translation.

### **Day 2**

- Python Basics
- Python debugging

- AI limitations:
  - Context is limited. Each model has its own context length.
  - Hallucinations
  - AI confidence
  - Calculations
  - It AI struggles to the answer right in first 3 times it hallucinates really bad.
  - In smaller languages (e.g. Lithuanian it struggles)
