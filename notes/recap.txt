- LLM is just an algorithm with weights. This is launched by LLM inference.
- Weight and GPU.
- internet compressed into weights.
- Pretraining stage
- The LLMs just mimic text.
- An example of a pretraining dataset.
- Base Model
- Fine-tuning
- Pre-training is costly on GPU and fine-tuning is way cheaper.
- The bigger model the better in quality.
- The model are taught to use tools.
- Multimodal models
- The thinking models.
- LLM OS
- LLM Security

- Tokenization
- How prediction is updated
