Optional, advanced:

You have completed:

    You have memgpt code in:
    samples\functional-calling\mem_gpt.py

    Copy this code to your repository and enhance it with new functionality:
        1. Add new tool search_web (u can use duckduckgo)
        2. Update the chatbot to search the web if it does not have information in memory.

I want you to make the following changes:
1. Investigate Openai AI Agent SDK:
https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/
Refactor your code by using Openai ai agent sdk.

2. Make the following feature: When the search returns information, 
i want to an agent to review if there is enough information to answer the question.
If there is not enough information, try again with a different query.

Scenario is something like this:
I ask a question to a Search Agent. Search agent gives me information form search.
Before returning the information to the user, the 'Review agent' checks if there is enough information to answer the question.
If there is not enough information, search happens again with a different query.

In practice this is called close to Deep Research you can google it.
