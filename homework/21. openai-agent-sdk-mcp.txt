We are entering AI agents and MCP.

Please create an agent using:
- https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/
- https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/ (agents with mcp)
- tools taken from https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mcp (ideally use MCP)

- Investigate what is this firecrawl and what it provides.

This agent should have the following workflow:
- The agent accepts 'a question'
- Agent is able to extract key phrase or keyword from your question.
- Then the agent performs the Search using firecrawl (firecrawl_search tool) with your keywords.
- Agent responds with the nicely formatted answer with the answer with the information form search.

This should be just a python script.
